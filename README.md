# Predictive-Stock-Price-Analysis-and-forecasting
Predictive Stock Price Analysis is a Python-based data science project that uses machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model implementation for accurate predictions. It features visualizations that offer insights into trends and the model's performance.
*Predictive Stock Price Analysis Project*
In this project, I developed a predictive model to forecast stock prices using historical data. Here's an overview of the steps I took:
1. *Data Collection*: I gathered historical stock data using the Yahoo Finance API through Python, ensuring a robust dataset for analysis.
2. *Feature Engineering*: I extracted relevant features such as open and close prices, volume, and moving averages to capture key market trends.
3. *Data Preprocessing*: I handled missing values using pandas and normalized/scaled features using techniques like Min-Max Scaler to enhance model performance.
4. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Through visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, I identified trends and patterns in the data. Correlation analysis helped me understand relationships between features.
5. *Model Selection*: I implemented both traditional time series models like ARIMA and machine learning models such as Random Forest to compare their predictive capabilities.
6. *Model Training and Evaluation*: I split the data into training and testing sets and evaluated model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared metrics.
*Next Steps*: I'm currently working on deploying the model using Flask to create a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
*Skills Demonstrated*:

This project showcases my ability to collect, process, and analyze financial data, as well as build predictive models to forecast stock prices. I'm excited to continue refining the model and exploring new applications in finance.
Still awaits to get deployed
